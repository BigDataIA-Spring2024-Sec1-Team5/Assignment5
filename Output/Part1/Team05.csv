Overview of Equity Portfolio Management,Equity Investments,2024,Level III,"Equities represent a sizable portion of the global investment universe and thus often
               represent a primary component of investors’ portfolios. Rationales for investing in
               equities include potential participation in the growth and earnings prospects of an
               economy’s corporate sector as well as an ownership interest in a range of business
               entities by size, economic activity, and geographical scope. Publicly traded equities
               are generally more liquid than other asset classes and thus may enable investors to
               more easily monitor price trends and purchase or sell securities with low transaction
               costs.
This reading provides an overview of equity portfolio management. Section 2 discusses
               the roles of equities in a portfolio. Section 3 discusses the equity investment universe,
               including several ways the universe can be segmented. Section 4 covers the income
               and costs in an equity portfolio. Section 5 discusses shareholder engagement between
               equity investors and the companies in which they invest. Section 6 discusses equity
               investment across the passive–active investment spectrum. A summary of key points
               completes the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the roles of equities in the overall portfolio; describe how an equity manager’s investment universe can be segmented; describe the types of income and costs associated with owning and managing an equity
                     portfolio and their potential effects on portfolio performance; describe the potential benefits of shareholder engagement and the role an equity manager
                     might play in shareholder engagement; describe rationales for equity investment across the passive–active spectrum.","This reading provides an overview of the roles equity investments may play in the
               client’s portfolio, how asset owners and investment managers segment the equity universe
               for purposes of defining an investment mandate, the costs and obligations of equity
               ownership (including shareholder engagement) and issues relevant to the decision to
               pursue active or passive management of an equity portfolio. Among the key points made
               in this reading are the following: Equities can provide several roles or benefits to an overall portfolio, including
                     capital appreciation, dividend income, diversification with other asset classes, and
                     a potential hedge against inflation. The inclusion of equities in a portfolio can be driven by a client’s goals or needs.
                     Portfolio managers often consider the following investment objectives and constraints
                     when deciding to include equities (or asset classes in general, for that matter) in
                     a client’s portfolio: risk objective; return objective; liquidity requirement; time horizon; tax concerns;
                        legal and regulatory factors ; and unique circumstances. Investors often segment the equity universe according to (1) size and style; (2) geography;
                     and (3) economic activity. Sources of equity portfolio income include dividends; securities lending fees and
                     interest; dividend capture; covered calls; and cash-covered puts (or cash-secured
                     puts). Sources of equity portfolio costs include management fees; performance fees; administration
                     fees; marketing/distribution fees; and trading costs. Shareholder engagement is the process whereby companies engage with their shareholders.
                     The process typically includes voting on corporate matters at general meetings and
                     other forms of communication, such as quarterly investor calls or in-person meetings. Shareholder engagement can provide benefits for both shareholders and companies. From
                     a company’s perspective, shareholder engagement can assist in developing a more effective
                     corporate governance culture. In turn, shareholder engagement may lead to better company
                     performance to the benefit of shareholders (as well as other stakeholders). Disadvantages of shareholder engagement include costs and time involved, pressure
                     on a company to meet near-term share price or earnings targets, possible selective
                     disclosure of information, and potential conflicts of interest. Activist investors (or activists) specialize in taking stakes in companies and creating
                     change to generate a gain on the investment. The participation of shareholders in general meetings, also known as general assemblies,
                     and the exercise of their voting rights are among the most influential tools available
                     for shareholder engagement. The choice of using active management or passive management is not an “either/or”
                     (binary) alternative but rather a decision involving a passive–active spectrum. Investors
                     may decide to position their portfolios across the passive–active spectrum based on
                     their confidence to outperform, client preference, suitable benchmarks, client-specific
                     mandates, risks/costs of active management, and taxes.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/overview-equity-portfolio-management,https://study.cfainstitute.org/app/member-access-refresher-readings-2024-cfa-program-level-iii#read/section/learning-outcomes-12
Industry and Company Analysis,Equity Investments,2022,Level II,"Industry and company analysis is a key step in the process of valuing companies and
               the securities they have issued. We will focus on how analysts use industry information
               and corporate disclosures to forecast a company’s future financial results.
Financial forecasts are the basis for fundamental equity valuation based on discounted
               cash flows and/or market multiples. An effective forecast model must be based on a
               thorough understanding of a company’s business, management, strategy, external environment,
               and historical results. Thus, an analyst begins with a review of the company and its
               environment—its industry, key products, strategic position, management, competitors,
               suppliers, and customers. Using this information, an analyst identifies key revenue
               and cost drivers and assesses the likely impact of relevant trends, such as economic
               conditions and technological developments. An analyst’s understanding of the fundamental
               drivers of the business and an assessment of future events provide a basis for developing
               inputs to the forecast model.
We begin our discussion with an overview of developing a forecast model. We then describe
               the general approach to forecasting each component of the income statement (revenue,
               operating costs, and non-operating costs), balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
               We then turn to special topics: the impact of competitive factors on prices and costs;
               the effects of inflation and deflation; technological developments; long-term forecasting;
               and building a company model. We then conclude and present a summary.","The member should be able to: compare top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid approaches for developing inputs to equity
                     valuation models; compare “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” approaches
                     to forecasting revenue; evaluate whether economies of scale are present in an industry by analyzing operating
                     margins and sales levels; forecast the following costs: cost of goods sold, selling general and administrative
                     costs, financing costs, and income taxes; describe approaches to balance sheet modeling; describe the relationship between return on invested capital and competitive advantage; explain how competitive factors affect prices and costs; judge the competitive position of a company based on a Porter’s five forces analysis; explain how to forecast industry and company sales and costs when they are subject
                     to price inflation or deflation; evaluate the effects of technological developments on demand, selling prices, costs,
                     and margins; explain considerations in the choice of an explicit forecast horizon; explain an analyst’s choices in developing projections beyond the short-term forecast
                     horizon; demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company model.","Industry and company analysis are essential tools of fundamental analysis. The key points made include the following: Analysts can use a top-down, bottom-up, or hybrid approach to forecasting income and expenses. Top-down approaches usually begin at the level of the overall economy. Bottom-up approaches begin at the level of the individual company or unit within the company (e.g., business segment). Time-series approaches are considered bottom-up, although time-series analysis can be a tool used in top-down approaches. Hybrid approaches include elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches. In a “growth relative to GDP growth” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst forecasts the growth rate of nominal gross domestic product and industry and company growth relative to GDP growth. In a “market growth and market share” approach to forecasting revenue, the analyst combines forecasts of growth in particular markets with forecasts of a company’s market share in the individual markets. Operating margins that are positively correlated with sales provide evidence of economies of scale in an industry. Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory are very closely linked to income statement projections. A common way to model working capital accounts is to use efficiency ratios. Return on invested capital (ROIC), defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of the profitability of investing in a company. High and persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competitive advantage. Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services. Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying such factors. Inflation (deflation) affects pricing strategy depending on industry structure, competitive forces, and the nature of consumer demand. When a technological development results in a new product that threatens to cannibalize demand for an existing product, a unit forecast for the new product combined with an expected cannibalization factor can be used to estimate the impact on future demand for the existing product. Factors influencing the choice of the explicit forecast horizon include the projected holding period, an investor’s average portfolio turnover, cyclicality of an industry, company-specific factors, and employer preferences.",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/industry-company-analysis,/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/industry-company-analysis.pdf
Discounted Dividend Valuation (2018),Equity Investments,2018,Level II,"Common stock represents an ownership interest in a business. A business in its operations generates a stream of cash flows, and as owners of the business, common stockholders have an equity ownership claim on those future cash flows. Beginning with John Burr Williams (1938), analysts have developed this insight into a group of valuation models known as discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models. DCF models—which view the intrinsic value of common stock as the present value of its expected future cash flows—are a fundamental tool in both investment management and investment research. This reading is the first of several that describe DCF models and address how to apply those models in practice.
Although the principles behind discounted cash flow valuation are simple, applying the theory to equity valuation can be challenging. Four broad steps in applying DCF analysis to equity valuation are:
In this reading, we take the perspective that dividends—distributions to shareholders authorized by a company’s board of directors—are an appropriate definition of cash flows. The class of models based on this idea is called dividend discount models, or DDMs. The basic objective of any DDM is to value a stock. The variety of implementations corresponds to different ways to model a company’s future stream of dividend payments. The steps of choosing a discount rate methodology and estimating the discount rate involve the same considerations for all DCF models, so they have been presented separately in a reading on return concepts.
The reading is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of present value models. A general statement of the dividend discount model follows in Section 3. Forecasting dividends, individually and in detail, into the indefinite future is not generally practicable, so the dividend-forecasting problem is usually simplified. One approach is to assign dividends to a stylized growth pattern. The simplest pattern—dividends growing at a constant rate forever—is the constant growth (or Gordon growth) model, discussed in Section 4. For some companies, it is more appropriate to view earnings and dividends as having multiple stages of growth; multistage dividend discount models are presented in Section 5 along with spreadsheet modeling. Section 6 lays out the determinants of dividend growth rates, and the final section summarizes the reading.","The candidate should be able to: compare dividends, free cash flow, and residual income as inputs to discounted cash flow models and identify investment situations for which each measure is suitable; calculate and interpret the value of a common stock using the dividend discount model (DDM) for single and multiple holding periods; calculate the value of a common stock using the Gordon growth model and explain the model’s underlying assumptions; calculate and interpret the implied growth rate of dividends using the Gordon growth model and current stock price; calculate and interpret the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) and the component of the leading price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) related to PVGO; calculate and interpret the justified leading and trailing P/Es using the Gordon growth model; calculate the value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock; describe strengths and limitations of the Gordon growth model and justify its selection to value a company’s common shares; explain the assumptions and justify the selection of the two-stage DDM, the H-model, the three-stage DDM, or spreadsheet modeling to value a company’s common shares; explain the growth phase, transitional phase, and maturity phase of a business; describe terminal value and explain alternative approaches to determining the terminal value in a DDM; calculate and interpret the value of common shares using the two-stage DDM, the H-model, and the three-stage DDM; estimate a required return based on any DDM, including the Gordon growth model and the H-model; explain the use of spreadsheet modeling to forecast dividends and to value common shares; calculate and interpret the sustainable growth rate of a company and demonstrate the use of DuPont analysis to estimate a company’s sustainable growth rate; evaluate whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the market based on a DDM estimate of value.","This reading provided an overview of DCF models of valuation, discussed the estimation
of a stock’s required rate of return, and presented in detail the dividend discount model. In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected)
    future cash flows V 0 = n ∑ t = 1 CF t ( 1 + r ) t V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n CF t ( 1 + r ) t where V0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CFt
    is the (expected) cash
    flow at time t, and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely
    lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity. Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities,
    including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend
    approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company
    has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the
    company’s profitability, and the investor has a noncontrol (minority ownership)
    perspective. The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the
    company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE,
    free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority
    ownership) perspective. The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay
    dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative. The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 V 0 = D 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 = D 1 + P 1 ( 1 + r ) 1 where
    D
    1 is the expected dividend at time 1 and
    V0 is the stock’s (expected)
    value at time 0. Assuming that
    V0 is equal to today’s market price,
    P
    0, the
    expected holding-period return is r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 r = D 1 + P 1 P 0 − 1 = D 1 P 0 + P 1 − P 0 P 0 The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period
    n and the gen
    -
    eral expression for the DDM are, respectively, V 0 = n ∑ t = 1 D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∞ ∑ t = 1 D t ( 1 + r ) t V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D t ( 1 + r ) t + P n ( 1 + r ) n and V 0 = ∑ t = 1 ∞ D t ( 1 + r ) t There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First,
    an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of
    several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number
    of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining divi
    -
    dends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting
    share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts. The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate
    g for
    -
    ever, so that
    D
    t
    =
    Dt–
    1(1 +
    g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model
    has a value of V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) r − g , or V 0 = D 1 r − g where r > g The value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is
    V0 =
    D
    /
    r, where
    D is the stock’s (constant) annual dividend. Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a
    stock’s expected rate of return is r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g r = D 0 ( 1 + g ) P 0 + g = D 1 P 0 + g Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stock’s required rate
    of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend
    growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate
    assumption).
    The present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) is the part of a stock’s total
    value,
    V0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to
    the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is
    V0 =
    E
    1
    /
    r +
    PVGO, where
    E
    1
    /
    r is defined as the no-growth value per share. The leading price-to-earnings ratio (
    P
    0
    /
    E
    1) and the trailing price-to-earnings
    ratio (
    P
    0
    /
    E
    0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as,
    respectively, P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g P 0 E 1 = D 1 / E 1 r − g = 1 − b r − g and P 0 E 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g ) / E 0 r − g = ( 1 − b ) ( 1 + g ) r − g The above expressions give a stock’s justified price-to-earnings ratio based on
    forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate). The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity
    indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow
    at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the nominal growth rate of the
    economy. Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and
    required rate of return. For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company
    enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called super
    -
    normal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature
    phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings
    growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long
    term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects. The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage
    1 and Stage 2 V 0 = n ∑ t = 1 D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) V 0 = ∑ t = 1 n D 0 ( 1 + g S ) t ( 1 + r ) t + D 0 ( 1 + g S ) n ( 1 + g L ) ( 1 + r ) n ( r − g L ) where
    gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and
    gL is the
    expected growth rate in the second period. The terminal stock value,
    Vn, is sometimes found with the Gordon growth
    model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date. The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from
    a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1, and then
    grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L V 0 = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) r − g L + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L = D 0 ( 1 + g L ) + D 0 H ( g S − g L ) r − g L There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the
    middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly
    in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3. Spreadsheet models are very flexible, providing the analyst with the ability to
    value any pattern of expected dividends. In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly
    priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the
    H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return.
    For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial
    and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted
    dividend stream to the current market price. Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of
    expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions
    about growth, they can provide useful approximations. Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting
    models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends
    on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b × ROE. This expression can
    be expanded further, using the DuPont formula, as g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity g = Net income − Dividends Net income × Net income Sales × Sales Total assets × Total assets Shareholders' equity",https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/2018/discounted-dividend-valuation,Link Not Found
