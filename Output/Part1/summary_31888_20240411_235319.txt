# Technical Note: Valuation Methods for Common Stocks 

## Introduction

The valuation of a company's common stock is a crucial aspect of investment analysis. It involves determining the intrinsic value of the stock, which is the present value of all future cash flows generated by the company. Various methods can be used to value common stocks, including discounted cash flow (DCF) models such as the dividend discount model (DDM), the Gordon growth model, and the present value of growth opportunities (PVGO). This technical note will discuss these methods and their applications in valuing common stocks.

## Dividends, Free Cash Flow, and Residual Income as Inputs to DCF Models

DCF models use the concept of the time value of money to determine the present value of future cash flows. The three commonly used inputs in DCF models are dividends, free cash flow (FCF), and residual income. Dividends are the cash payments made by a company to its shareholders, and FCF is the amount of cash available to the company after all necessary capital expenditures have been made. Residual income is the excess of a company's net income over the required return on its equity capital. 

## Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The DDM is a widely used DCF model that values a stock by discounting its future dividends. The model assumes that the value of a stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends. It can be calculated using the following equation:

<div align="center">$P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r-g}$</div>

Where:

- $P_0$ is the current stock price
- $D_1$ is the expected dividend in the next period
- $r$ is the required rate of return
- $g$ is the expected growth rate of dividends 

The DDM is suitable for valuing stable and mature companies that pay regular dividends.

## Gordon Growth Model

The Gordon growth model is a variation of the DDM that assumes a constant growth rate in dividends. It is based on the principle that the value of a stock is equal to the present value of its future dividends, plus the present value of its terminal value. The model can be expressed as:

<div align="center">$P_0 = \frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}$</div>

Where:

- $P_0$ is the current stock price
- $D_0$ is the current dividend
- $g$ is the expected growth rate of dividends 
- $r$ is the required rate of return

The Gordon growth model is suitable for valuing companies with a stable dividend growth rate.

## Present Value of Growth Opportunities (PVGO)

The PVGO is the value of a company's growth opportunities, which is not reflected in its current stock price. It can be calculated by subtracting the present value of current dividends from the current stock price. PVGO is an important component in determining a stock's intrinsic value.

## Justified Leading and Trailing P/E Ratios

The justified leading P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the expected earnings per share (EPS) in the next period. The justified trailing P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the expected EPS in the current period. These ratios can be calculated using the following equations:

<div align="center">$P/E_{leading} = \frac{P_0}{E_1}$</div>

<div align="center">$P/E_{trailing} = \frac{P_0}{E_0}$</div>

Where:

- $P/E_{leading}$ is the justified leading P/E ratio
- $P/E_{trailing}$ is the justified trailing P/E ratio
- $P_0$ is the current stock price
- $E_0$ is the current EPS
- $E_1$ is the expected EPS in the next period

The justified P/E ratios can be compared to the actual P/E ratio to determine if a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.

## Preferred Stock Valuation

The value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock can be calculated using the following equation:

<div align="center">$V_{preferred} = \frac{D_{preferred}}{r_{preferred}}$</div>

Where:

- $V_{preferred}$ is the value of preferred stock
- $D_{preferred}$ is the annual dividend on preferred stock
- $r_{preferred}$ is the required rate of return on preferred stock

## Strengths and Limitations of the Gordon Growth Model

The Gordon growth model is a simple and easy-to-use valuation method. It is based on the assumption of a constant growth rate, which may not hold true for all companies. The model is also sensitive to changes in the growth rate and required return assumptions.

## Selection of Valuation Methods

The selection of a valuation method depends on the characteristics of the company being valued. The Gordon growth model is suitable
